# My Classes Examples
with selenuim module  I made basic examples.

for YemekSepet.py;
if you want to change from burger to pizza just change here to pizza;

srchBtn.send_keys("pizza") 
so after that you need to change codes to comment line;

#foodFrst = self.browser.find_element_by_xpath("//*[@id='cboxLoadedContent']/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/button")
#foodFrst.click()
#time.sleep(3)

thats All! you can order with just one click enjoy!
